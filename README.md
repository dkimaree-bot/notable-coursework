1. ### BABY NAME DATA VIEWER/Project 2

**Grade: 19/20**

#### Description
A C program that analyzes Ontario baby name data from 1914-2023. The program reads CSV files containing historical baby name records and provides an interactive menu system for data exploration and visualization.

#### Features
- **Name frequency search**: Find how many babies were born with a specific name across all years
- **Top 5 rankings**: Display the most popular names (male, female, and overall) for any given year
- **ASCII histogram**: Visualize name popularity trends over time using text-based bar charts with 5-year cohorts
- **Data validation**: Input validation for years (1914-2023) and menu selections
- **Data export**: Combines male and female datasets into a single output file

#### Technologies Used
- **Language**: C
- **Libraries**: stdio.h, string.h, ctype.h, math.h
- **Concepts**: File I/O, data structures, string manipulation, sorting algorithms, data aggregation

#### What I Learned
- Working with large CSV datasets in C
- Designing aggregate data structures for efficient data storage and retrieval
- Implementing case-insensitive string matching
- Creating ASCII-based data visualizations
- Input validation and error handling
- File parsing and data combination from multiple sources

#### Given Files
- `femalebabynames.csv` - Female baby name dataset (1914-2023)
- `malebabynames.csv` - Male baby name dataset (1914-2023)
