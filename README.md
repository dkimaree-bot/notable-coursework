## Notable Coursework
Collection of academic projects demonstrating problem-solving and software development skills across different programming paradigms. These projects challenged me to think creatively, approach problems from multiple angles, and build functional solutions from scratch. Each one taught me something new about both programming and the problem-solving process itself.

### Projects
**1. Baby Name Data Viewer**
*Language:* C | Grade: 19/20

A data analysis program that processes 100+ years of Ontario baby name records. Features an interactive menu system for exploring name trends, generating ASCII histograms, and ranking popular names by year. Handles large CSV datasets with efficient data structures and implements comprehensive input validation.

Key Skills: File I/O, data structures, string manipulation, sorting algorithms, ASCII visualization

**2. ASOUE Hangman Game**
*Language:* Bash | Grade: 8/10

An interactive word-guessing game themed around "A Series of Unfortunate Events". Features color-coded terminal output, progressive ASCII art, customizable word length selection, and robust input validation. Built using Unix text processing utilities and advanced shell scripting techniques.

Key Skills: Shell scripting, parameter substitution, ANSI color codes, Unix utilities (awk, sed, tr, grep), input sanitization

Technologies Overview
Languages: C, Bash
Concepts: File processing, data structures, string manipulation, input validation, ASCII art, terminal UI design
Tools: GCC, Unix/Linux command-line tools
What I Learned
These projects taught me to approach problems systematically, break down complex requirements into manageable pieces, and build complete, functional programs. Beyond just writing code that works, I learned the importance of user experience, error handling, and writing maintainable code that others can understand.
